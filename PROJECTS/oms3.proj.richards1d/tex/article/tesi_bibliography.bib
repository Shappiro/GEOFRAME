                  Major breakthroughs in chip and software design have
                  been observed for the last nine years. In October 2001,
                  IBM released the world's first multicore processor -
                  POWER4. Six years later, in February 2007, NVIDIA made
                  a public release of CUDA SDK - a set of development
                  tools to write algorithms for execution on graphic
                  processing units (GPUs). Although software vendors have
                  started working on parallelizing their products, the
                  vast majority of existing code is still sequential and
                  does not effectively utilize modern multicore CPUs and
                  manycore GPUs.
		  
		  This article describes Parallel Colt - a multithreaded
		  Java library for scientific computing and image
		  processing. In addition to describing the design
		  and functionality of Parallel Colt, a comparison to
		  MATLAB is presented. Two ImageJ plugins for iterative
		  image deblurring and motion correction of PET brain
		  images are described as typical applications of this
		  library. Performance comparisons with MATLAB including
		  GPU computations via AccelerEyes' Jacket toolbox,
		  are also given.",

pages = "1483-1496",

abstract = "Numerical approximation based on different forms of the governing partial differential equation can lead to
significantly different results for unsaturated flow problems. Numerical solution based on the standard h-based form
of RIchards equation generally yelds poor results, characterizede by large mass balance errors and erroneous estimates of infiltration
depth. Conversely, numerical solutions based on the mixed form of the Richards equation can be shown to possess the conservative property, so that mass is perfectly conserved. This leads to significant improvement in numerical solution performance, while requiring no additional computational effort. Hovewer, use of the mass-conservative method does not guarantee good solutions. Accurate solution of the unsaturated flow equation also requires use of a diagonal time (or mass) matrix. Only when diagonal time matrices are used can the solutions be shown to obey a minimum principle, which guarantees smooth, nonoscillatory infiltration profiles. This highlights the fact that proper treatment of the time derivative is critical in the numerical solution of unsaturated flow.",

abstract = "A new and relatively simple equation for the soil-water content-pressure head curve, $\theta(h)$, is described in this paper. The particular form of the equation enables one to derive closed-form analytical expression for the relative hydraulic conductivity, $K_{r}$, when substituted in the predictive conductivity models of N.T. Burdine or Y. Mualem. The resulting expression for $K_{r}(h)$ contain three independent parameters which may be obtained by fitting the proposed soil-water retention model to experimental data. Results obtained with the closed-form analytical expression based on the Mualem theory are compared with a wide range of hydraulic properties. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is predicted well in four out of five cases. It is found that a reasonable description of the soil-water contents is important for an accurate prediction of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.",

journal = "International Journal for numerical methods in fluids",
volume = "32",,
year = 2000,
pages = "331-348",

abstract = "A semi-implicit finite difference model based on the three-dimensional shallow water equations is
modified to use unstructured grids. There are obvious advantages in using unstructured grids in problems
with a complicated geometry. In this development, the concept of unstructured orthogonal grids is
introduced and applied to this model. The governing differential equations are discretized by means of
a semi-implicit algorithm that is robust, stable and very efficient. The resulting model is relatively simple,
conserves mass, can fit complicated boundaries and yet is sufficiently flexible to permit local mesh
refinements in areas of interest. Moreover, the simulation of the flooding and drying is included in a
natural and straightforward manner. These features are illustrated by a test case for studies of
convergence rates and by examples of flooding on a river plain and flow in a shallow estuary.
