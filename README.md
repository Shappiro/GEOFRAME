Repository for handling scripts and scratches for GEOFRAME/OMS3 project
=======================================================================

**Next steps for the project are**:
* [x] Create a script to run compilation, project directory structure generation and simfiles
* Test the script thorougfully (mostly done)
* Think about the implementation of some FORTRAN code, starting from the links provided:
	1. https://alm.engr.colostate.edu/cb/wiki/16993
	2. https://alm.engr.colostate.edu/cb/wiki/17097
	3. https://alm.engr.colostate.edu/cb/wiki/17105#section-OMS3_2FFortran9x+Integration+Example_
	4. https://teamwork.niwa.co.nz/display/IFM/Implementing+a+FORTRAN+model+in+OMS3 > see sparrow example
* Think about the needed JAVA classes for the Richards integration code from *Casulli et al*.

**Should I take a look at some FORTRAN components that we already want to integrate inside the GEOFRAME?**
